# IZEvent

IZEvent is a pure-Swift alternative to NSNotificationCenter. It strives to be easy, safe, and simple. Pro's over NSNotificationCenter:

- Memory-safe: No memory leaks are possible and no need to remove observers in deinit
- Thread-safe: Delivers events to main thread by default
- Type-safe: A pure-Swift implementation means that everything is type-checked at _compile-time_, not run-time
- User-safe: Every instance can only ever have 1 function registered with an event at a time--no double registering is possible

## Installation

Add the folowing to your Podfile:

```
pod 'IZEvent', :git => 'https://github.com/izeni-team/izevent.git'
```

If you want to specify a specific version of IZEvent:

```
pod 'IZEvent', :git => 'https://github.com/izeni-team/izevent.git', :commit => 'v0.2.0'
```

## Usage

1: Create an event

```swift
class MyService {
    static let simpleEvent = IZEvent<Void>() // Synchronous, main thread delivery by default.
    static let complexEvent = IZEvent<(String, Int)>(queue: dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND, 0))
}
```

2: Listen for an event

```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        MyService.simpleEvent.register(self, function: MyViewController.simpleEventEmitted)
        MyService.complexEvent.register(self, function: MyViewController.complexEventEmitted)
    }

    func simpleEventEmitted() {
        assert(NSThread.isMainThread()) // Guaranteed to be run on main thread.
        print("Something happened!")
    }

    func complexEventEmitted(string: String, integer: Int) {
        assert(NSThread.isMainThread() == false) // All functions from this event are delivered on the background thread.
        print("string: \(string), integer: \(integer)")
    }
}
```

3: Emit an event

```swift
class MyService {
    ...
    func somethingHappened() {
        MyService.simpleEvent.post()
        MyService.complexEvent.post(("How Many?", 3))
    }
}
```
